# Twinkle Toes

**Twinkle Toes** is an e-commerce store that specializes in everyone's favorite accessory: sparkley shoes.

[Deployed Site](https://sharp-kilby-04a8bc.netlify.app/) can be accessed here.

## Description

**Twinkle Toes** is an application built using the MERN stack (i.e. a React front-end and a MongoDB + Express back-end).

The application allows customers to browse the inventory of **Twinkle Toes** and leave reviews on products. 

Furthermore, the application gives admins full-CRUD functionality (i.e. the ability to create, read, update, and delete products from the backend).

## Collaboration

This was the first project in which I co-coded with other software engineers. Serving as Git Manager, this project taught me how to handle the Git Workflow with a remote team.

In addition, this project was a collaboration with General Assembly's UX/UI cohort. The UX/UI team that we were paired with produced the wireframes and we were tasked with bringing them to life.
